nrow=(HANES)
# There are 1112 observations and 23 variables.
ncol=(HANES)
# Here we can see that most of the people that have diabetes have a A1C level of atleast 5.0 and there is a lot of 
# density around the 7.5 test level area. This makes sense because the consensus is that people get diabetes when 
# their test levels start eaching near 6%. 
# This plot shows a positive relationship between A1C levels and having diabetes. In other words, the higher someone's 
# A1C levels, the more likely they are to have been diagnosed with diabetes. This confirms my hypothesis. 
# Below - MAke a ggplot with asthetic color for he variable DX_DBTS
ggplot(data = HANES) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = log(A1C), y = log(UACR), color=DX_DBTS))
# This color visualization/graph reveals many things. Here it can be seen that most of 
# the people in the clusters (each dot represens a person) does not have diabetes. 
# Thus, it appears that UACR and A1C may not be risk factors for diabetes. 
# Just to recap, A1C is blood test level. Research shows that A1C test results of 6.5% or above
# indicate diabetes and prediabetes is from a A1C test of 5.7% to 6.4% so these results are
# consistent with mainstream data. Source: https://www.virginiamason.org/whatarenormalbloodglucoselevels

# This color visualization/graph reveals many things. Here it can be seen that most of 
# the people have no diabetes. The people that do have diabetes when considering the log(triglyceride) vs log(Glucose)
# is seldom and sparse. This may indicate that triglycerie and glucose levels are not sole risk factors for diabetes.

# For the above graph we see that the dots are congragated in one general areal between values of 3 and 5.5 on the 
# log(Triglyceride) scale and from 4.25 and 4.75 on the log(glucose) scale. It is difficult to see the shape of the 
# dots to indicate which dot is large or small so another type of graph would be best to look at indicating agegroup.

# Patterns show us that there might be certain variables that affect the relationship and if so what are those variables? 
# In this case the veriable, since we are looking at glucose and ldestimate can be age and gender, but especially age.
# We saw earlier in our exploratory analysis that age group had significant impacts on the variation in glucose and ldestimate
# with older groups haveing higher levels of glucose and ldestimates

# Could this pattern be due to a coincidence? (random change)? 
# It is highly unlikely that this pattern change is due to a coincidence.

# effect of total cholesterol removing the effects of LDL

#Overall from my exploratory data analysis I learned a lot (I also learned that this could literally go on forever)

# My exploratory data analysis revealed that age is a huge mitagating factor when looking at a lot of the 
# health variables such as glucose levels, HDL, Diabetes, and cholesterol levels, which is to be expected given 
# that research shows as a person gets older their health tends to worsen, especially their cardiovascular health, diabetic health as 
# well as glucose levels. It would be very interesting to see if there are any patterns between these variables, age, and race.
# For example, does a 60 year old white male have the same chance of having high cholesterol levels as an Asian American male at age 60? 
# What factors such as neighbhorhood walkability and access to affordable food affect one's cholesterol level? 
# I am interested in taking this research even further by analyzing the patterns and relationships between socioeconomic factors and 
# health determinants as well as risk factors and health variables.
